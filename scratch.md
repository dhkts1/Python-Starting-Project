### Update mkdocs.yml

The mkdocs.yml file will need to be updated to include the new directory structure. Here's an example configuration:

```yaml
# Example addition to mkdocs.yml
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Learning Path:
      - Beginner's Guide: learning-path/beginners-guide.md
      - Intermediate Topics: learning-path/intermediate-topics.md
      - Advanced Techniques: learning-path/advanced-techniques.md
  - Tutorials:
      - Setup Your First Project: tutorials/setup-your-first-project.md
      - Adding a Feature: tutorials/adding-a-feature.md
      - Testing Your Code: tutorials/testing-your-code.md
  - Tools Guide:
      - Code Quality: tools-guide/code-quality.md
      - Documentation: tools-guide/documentation.md
      - Testing: tools-guide/testing.md
      - Project Management: tools-guide/project-management.md
  - Architecture:
      - IDE Setup: architecture/ide-setup.md
      - Configuration: architecture/configuration.md
      - Logging: architecture/logging.md
      - Lazy Loading: architecture/lazy-loading.md
  - Development:
      - Simplified Workflow: development/simplified-workflow.md
      - Workflow: development/workflow.md
      - Pre-commit Hooks: development/pre-commit-hooks.md
  - Technologies:
      - Overview: technologies/index.md
      # Existing technology entries...
  - API Reference: api/index.md
```

### Cross-Reference Implementation

To ensure no content is lost during the transition, add cross-references to the existing files that point to the new structure. For example, add this to the top of getting-started.md:

```markdown
!!! note "New Documentation Structure"
    This content is being migrated to a more learning-focused structure. See:

    - [Beginner's Guide](learning-path/beginners-guide.md)
    - [Setup Tutorial](tutorials/setup-your-first-project.md)

    The original content will remain available until the migration is complete.
